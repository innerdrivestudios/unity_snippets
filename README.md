# Unity Snippets
Repository with some handy unity snippets and tools

## Tools:
1. ColliderUtility - remove all colliders from objects and re-add bounding box, sphere or capsule colliders
2. MissingComponentUtility - find and removing missing components from gameobjects
3. Notes - add documentation notes directly to your game objects
4. PivotPointUtility - like 'Center on Children' but then on the bottom center ;)
5. ScreenshotUtility - convert game objects to transparent 2d sprites to be used on UI elements
