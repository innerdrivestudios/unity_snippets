# Unity Snippets
Repository with some handy unity snippets and tools, use at your own risk :).

## Tools:
1. Circlelizer - quickly position elements in a circle
2. ClassLevelTooltips - allows you to add a classlevel tooltip which shows up when you hover over the component name in the inspector
3. ColliderUtility - remove all colliders from objects and re-add bounding box, sphere or capsule colliders
4. ExtensionClasses - useful additional methods for common classes (collections, materials, (rect) transform)
5. MissingComponentUtility - find and removing missing components from gameobjects
6. Notes - add documentation notes directly to your game objects
7. PivotPointUtility - like 'Center on Children' but then on the bottom center ;)
8. PrefabReplacer - replaces any object in your scene with a prefab selected from a set
9. ScreenshotUtility - convert game objects to transparent 2d sprites to be used on UI elements
10. Several useful properties (range, readonly)
